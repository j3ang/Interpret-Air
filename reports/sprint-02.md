## Conclusion/Sprint Retrospective
The Main goals for this sprint was to get vagrant and packer started, along with our core APIs developement. We were able to complish some goals of the sprint2 but not all of them as we tend to work on this project on weekends due to our schedule. In gengeral, we have good start as our developers gained more knowledge on vidyo api, and google speech to text. We have reached out to the vidyo support team and did testing on google api. For our next sprint we need to start constantly delivery value from each member and get better at github management as now we spent a lot of time on reasearching and testing. In the next sprint, we need to review our minestones and make more realistc goals for midterm delieveable.
