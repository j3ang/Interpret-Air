# ITMT 430 
# Team 5 Octocat - Sprint One Report
# InterpretAir Project

First Day of Sprint: January 15th, 2018
Last Day of Sprint:	February 9th, 2018


##### Project Goal
Our project is called InterpretAir and it is going to be a web application that uses real-time video translation.
The goal is to improve the communication quality between people who don’t speak the same language by utilizing existing technologies (i.e. Amazon Transcribe, SendBird) in the form of API's and building our own product.

##### Project Objectives
Enhance the user’s experience of digital communication by integrating real-time translation technology into a video chat app/platform.

##### Scope
This project will be a web-based Real Time Communication platform used to transcribe and translate communication remotely between users.
Possible features include translation between numerous languages, chat room integration, storage of chat data, data encryption, user authentication, and features for assistive hearing.

##### Sprint 1 Role Functions

###### Project Manager
The PM is responsible for general team management and organization. For this sprint, the PM set up meetings to discuss project ideas and the design of the project. The PM is also in charge of making sure the deliverables are turned in and that atomic goals are assigned to other team members. We had several in-depth meetings that covered a lot of ground and brought everyone to the same speed. The main goals and tasks assigned for sprint one were:
1. Finalize decision of which project the team wanted to work on.
2. formulate a general skeleton of project, including design, features, and which technologies to utilize.
3. Research, Research, Research!

###### Developer
The Lead Developer is tasked with the bulk of coding and programming and making sure that the code is working and functional. They make use of a programming language to build and deploy features. The load for this role will be heavier in the next sprint. For sprint one, the Developer researched security technologies including authentication and Express.js for the server side. He reported valuable information to the team about which database to choose (Mongo DB) and tested several technologies including:
- OAuth (Concept)
- Flutter (Package that enables OAuth)
- Generator-rest (Template of web app to test OAuth)

###### Junior Developer
The Junior Developer works with the head Developer and the Web Developer to supply code, bug fixes, and security maintenance. For this sprint, he mainly researched different technologies including Amazon Transcribe and Google Translate. He also did some market research to find out how valuable a video transcribing chat app would be, and how/if it could be utilized by, or sold to, foreign markets and industries.

###### IT operations
The IT Ops person is esponsible for ensuring and deploying infrastructure and code, which we don't have applicable in this sprint. IT ops also organizes the infrastructure drawings using Visio diagrams. In this sprint, he created a Google drive for everyone to work on files and drop them so everyone can see them, and he created the Visio diagram so that the team can visually see what functions we should work on and incorporate into the project.


###### UI/UX Developer
The UI/UX Developer (or Web Developer) is responsible for designing, testing, and documenting the UI/UX of the project. This includes how the web app looks and the layout of the overall project. In this sprint, The Web Developer provided the team with the idea for the project. He transferred all the necessary source code into the team's repository on GitHub, and created a basic shell of a web app for the login screen and the dashboard screen. He also implemented various useful Slack integrations like Meekan Scheduling and @Niles.

### Sprint One Atomic Goals

- Research how to build and develop a web app:  **Completed**
- Develop a flowchart/diagram of basic skeleton of project:   **Completed**
- Familiarize how to use new technologies (Slack, GitHub, Vagrant, etc.):  **Completed**
- Commits on the GitHub Repo: **30**
- Approximate Hours Spent by Team: **75**
Our team had some issues with communication due to conflicting and busy schedules. We also had to iron out our decisions as far as where and how to start on the actual building of the app. These issues have since been resolved and the team has a better idea of what needs to be done in Sprint two. Every team member reported learning a lot about several different technologies and applications. Some of these are:
| App/Tech| Function
|---------|:----------|
| Microsoft Azure | IT Ops
| Github | Version Control
| Slack | Communication |
| Trello | Communication |
| OAuth | Security|
| appear.in | Video Chat Site |
| API's | Tech for Building On |
| jQuery | JavaScript Library |
| Mongo DB | Database Option|
...and countless others
##### Sprint Two Goals
1. Generate deploy keys
2. Demo a Vidyo.io call
3. Integrate authentication
4. Refine User Interface
5. Setup Mongo DB database along with a schema
6. Create/Design profile, contacts, and settings web pages
7. Create logout action
8. Extract Audio

#### Conclusion/Sprint Retrospective

The DevOps function that applied most to this sprint was probably:
>the goal of having a common work system and using a shared vocabulary, so that work can be prioritized globally. (p.73)

This is where GitHub is vital to the connection between Development and Operations. It provides a singular workspace that also allows for testing and usability.
